<h3 align="left">Overview</h3>
This Python script implements the Envelope, a non-parametric regression technique used in financial analysis to smooth and analyze time series data. The envelope is particularly useful for identifying trends and volatility in financial markets by estimating local means using Gaussian kernel smoothing.

The script fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculates the Envelope, and visualizes the results overlayed on the price chart. This allows analysts to visually assess how the price interacts with the envelope, aiding in trend analysis, risk assessment, and trading strategy development.

* Trend Analysis: Helps in visualizing trends and identifying periods of significant price movement.
* Volatility Assessment: Provides insights into price volatility by analyzing the distance between the upper and lower envelopes.
* Trading Strategies: Can be used to develop trading signals based on price interactions with the envelope.
